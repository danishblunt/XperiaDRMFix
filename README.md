# XperiaDRMFix

Replaces lib with dummy one to force L3 instead of using L1 without DRMKey which causes issues for multiple services. 

Works with other devices as well.

Little PSA:
Be careful what you download on XDA, incompetent powertripping mods don't care about quality control, you can spread malware on XDA quite easily.
