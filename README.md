# XperiaDRMFix

Replaces lib with dummy one to force L3 instead of using L1 without DRMKey which causes issues for multiple services. 

Works with other devices as well.

Little PSA:
Be careful what you download on XDA, incompetent powertripping mods don't care about quality control, you can spread malware on XDA quite easily. Do not trust anything that isnt open source and don't trust incompetent mods to protect you from malicious files.
